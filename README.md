Seaborn is a powerful Python library that makes it easy to create informative and attractive data visualizations. This 4-hour course provides an introduction to how you can use Seaborn to create a variety of plots, including scatter plots, count plots, bar plots, and box plots, and how you can customize your visualizations.

You’ll explore this library and create Seaborn plots based on a variety of real-world data sets, including exploring how air pollution in a city changes through the day and looking at what young people like to do in their free time. This data will give you the opportunity to find out about Seaborn’s advantages first hand, including how you can easily create subplots in a single figure and how to automatically calculate confidence intervals.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to use Seaborn in various situations to explore your data and effectively communicate the results of your data analysis to others. These skills are highly sought-after for data analysts, data scientists, and any other job that may involve creating data visualizations. If you’d like to continue your learning, this course is part of several tracks, including the Data Visualization track, where you can add more libraries and techniques to your skillset.
